# DelhiCovidAnalysis
 This project aims to analyze mortality patterns in Delhi based on two key factors: geographic characteristics (urban and rural areas) and the age demo graphics of its residents. The data used for this analysis was obtained through  a Right To Information (RTI) request from various administrative bodies in  Delhi.
